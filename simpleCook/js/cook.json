This bread is a new favorite of mine, and the fact that it takes minimal effort to make means that it has become a staple in our home.",

    "description": "Salt your flat iron steaks on both sides and let them sit, uncovered, in the fridge up to overnight, and at least 1 hour. I like to set them on a rack over a tray to catch any juices. This preseasons your meat and will help develop a better crust on the grill. Get your grill very hot and clean and oil your grates as I described above. When you start this process, take your steaks out of the fridge to warm up a bit. You still want them cool, though, so no more than about 15 minutes. Grill your flat iron steaks hard on one side, a good 5 minutes without touching them. Flip and grill to the doneness you like, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the heat and the thickness of your steak. Use the finger test for doneness to determine this. Move your steaks from the grill, coat them with freshly cracked black pepper - or whatever spices and herbs you like - and let it rest 5 minutes. Slice across the grain (the narrow end), and squeeze citrus juice over it all.",

Finish with a hit of red-pepper flakes for heat, or embellish with herbs, lettuces, beans, soft-boiled eggs, feta, nuts and so on.",

Remove the duck from the pan, then turn up the heat. Add the potatoes to the pan, fry until brown and crisp, then scatter over the parsley and garlic. Scoop out with a slotted spoon onto a plate, then season with salt. Keep the pan on the heat. Fry the bacon until crisp, then add the cabbage. Cook for 1 min, add a splash of water, then fry for 2 mins, just until the cabbage is wilted. While the cabbage is cooking, whisk any juices from the duck with the vinegar and olive oil. To serve, carve the duck breast into slices. Fan out on large dinner plates, spoon a neat bundle of cabbage on one side, then pile a serving of potatoes on the other. Drizzle over the dressing and serve.",
